I helped create an application for a client through Georgia Tech's Technical Communications course. The client wanted a site that connects nonprofit organizations with food services which often have excess food at the end of the day.

    <a class="media-image" href="/images/abundant-world/1.png">
       <img src="/images/abundant-world/1.png" alt="Abundant World front page." />
    </a>
</figure>

We built the application using Ruby on Rails using Twitter Bootstrap with several brand and logo customizations. An admin interface was created to allow the client to manage the site.

       <img src="/images/abundant-world/2.png" alt="Administration page for approved nonprofits to look through food listings." />
       <figcaption>Approved nonprofits can look through and filter food listings.</figcaption>
    </a>
