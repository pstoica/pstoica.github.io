Ampersand was a local art community that I designed and developed in high school. It was dedicated to metro Atlanta's art scene.

Members could post literature, songs, images, and videos and browse through nearly 1,000 pieces of content with a variety of filters.

I created the site with [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and some scattered front-end knowledge I originally learned in middle school.

It lived on for over a year, and whatever is left is here for sentimental purposes.
