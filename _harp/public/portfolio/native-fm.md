native.fm started as a weekend-long hack at [PennApps 2013](http://2013f.pennapps.com), designed by [Kate Godwin](http://make.kategodwin.com) and developed by myself and [Kyle Petrovich](http://kpetrovi.ch) using Ruby on Rails. We won the _"Best Use of SoundCloud"_ prize.

We formed the idea out of frustration with current approaches to social music. Streaming services determine relevant artists from global listening data, homogenizing exploration and making it hard to branch out.

There are also hundreds of thousands of independent artists that are difficult to discover without a helping hand. We figured the best tastemakers are the local music fans.

Our approach to social music brings the experience closer to mixtape swapping on a larger scale: a listener sends a local song they love, and they receive one in return. You can list tags you'd prefer (genre, location, etc.), and we try to get you the best match.

We opted to use [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com) and [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) as song sources to put more emphasis on local independent music.

native.fm is currently being rewritten, but keep an eye out for its launch soon!
