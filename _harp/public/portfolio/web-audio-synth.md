The second synthesizer I've created, made for my Computer Audio class in Spring 2013. It should work on recent browsers, but the API is still a draft.

    	The synth implements polyphony, 3 sound generators with individual ADSR envelopes, 5 oscillator types, and a variable filter.

Visually, the synth was an attempt at using CSS to recreate Teenage Engineering's [OP-1](www.teenageengineering.com/products/op-1). I thought about emulating the OLED screen and rewriting the synth in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). Maybe one day.
