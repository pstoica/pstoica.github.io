During my summer 2012 internship in Santa Monica, I joined the Yahoo! Sports front-end team to help build their London Olympics site over the course of three months.

I collaborated with front-end, back-end, design, and editorial teams and helped with features, stylesheet optimizations, multi-device support, and internationalization. The site received several sponsorships and large amounts of traffic worldwide. One module I created was reused for other sponsorships after I left.

I learned to use Yahoo!'s PHP web framework along with their open source JavaScript library, [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/). I also submitted a few of patches for other Yahoo! products.

As of Yahoo!'s recent redesigns, this site is no longer available.
